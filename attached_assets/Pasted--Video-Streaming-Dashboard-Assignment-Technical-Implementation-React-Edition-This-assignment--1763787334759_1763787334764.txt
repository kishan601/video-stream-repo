💻 Video Streaming Dashboard Assignment:
Technical Implementation (React Edition)
This assignment requires the creation of a synchronized multi-stream dashboard using
React and HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).
📝 Task Details: Technical Implementation
1. HLS Generation Pipeline
● RTSP Source:
○ Use the provided RTSP link as the source for your streams:
rtsp://13.60.76.79:8554/live

● HLS Generation:
○ Identify and use a suitable tool (e.g., FFmpeg, MediaMTX, or similar media
server software) to continuously convert the RTSP stream into an accessible
HLS URL (.m3u8 playlist).

● Crucial Step: You must implement a method to simulate or create 5 to 6 distinct HLS
URLs from the single provided RTSP source.
2. React Dashboard Development
● Framework: Develop the entire dashboard using the React framework (functional
components with Hooks).
● Player Library: Integrate an appropriate HLS Player library that works well within a
React environment (e.g., a React wrapper for hls.js, or Video.js).
● Display Layout:
○ Create a dashboard that displays all 5 to 6 video players simultaneously.
○ The layout should be a responsive grid or matrix (e.g., 2x3 or 3x2).
● Synchronization (Primary Focus):
○ The most critical requirement is to ensure the 5-6 streams play as close to "in
sync" as possible.
○ Implement specific React logic, player configuration, or control methods to
achieve and maintain this tight synchronization across all video elements.

3. Reference
● The website https://monitor.theun1t.com/ serves as a visual reference for the general
multi-view monitoring dashboard layout and feel.
📦 Deliverables
● Dashboard Code (GitHub Repository Link):
○ A link to the repository containing the complete React application code.
● The repository README.md must contain all technical documentation, including:
○ A detailed explanation of the RTSP \rightarrow HLS conversion process and
the tools used.
○ An explanation of how the 5-6 distinct HLS streams were created/simulated.
○ A description of the React component logic and player methods implemented
to achieve stream synchronization.

● The README.md must also explain how to set up the environment and run the
application (npm install and npm start).
● Live Workable Link (Vercel/Netlify/Similar):
○ A link to the live, deployed version of the React dashboard (e.g., hosted on
Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms). This link must be functional and
demonstrate the synchronized stream playback.
